Open Ended Responses (Sample):

Q: What improvements would you suggest for the app?
Response 1: I think the app could benefit from more detailed mood options, like "excited," "calm," or "frustrated," to better capture the nuances of daily emotions.

Q: What improvements would you suggest for the app?
Response 1: The app is great, but it could benefit from a few enhancements:

# Plot Analysis

## reflection_effectiveness.png
This bar chart shows the progression of reflection effectiveness across all 5 runs of the experiment. The x-axis represents the response options ("Yes", "Somewhat", "No") and the y-axis shows the number of responses. Each run is represented by a different colored bar, allowing for easy comparison between versions. The chart clearly demonstrates the improvement in reflection effectiveness from Run 1 (where most users found the app ineffective) to Run 5 (where all users reported the app helped them reflect). This visualization highlights the impact of iterative improvements on the app's core functionality.

## ease_of_use.png
This bar chart illustrates the evolution of ease-of-use ratings across all runs. The x-axis shows the rating options ("Very Easy" to "Very Difficult") while the y-axis displays response counts. The progression from predominantly "Very Difficult" ratings in Run 1 to exclusively "Very Easy" ratings in Run 5 is striking. This chart effectively demonstrates how usability improvements in each iteration led to a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## streak_motivation.png
This bar chart tracks the motivational impact of the streak system across all runs. The x-axis shows response options ("Yes", "Somewhat", "No") and the y-axis displays response counts. The chart shows a clear trend of increasing motivation, with Run 1 showing little motivation and Run 5 showing unanimous positive motivation. This visualization underscores the effectiveness of the gamification elements in encouraging consistent journaling habits.

## final_ease_of_use_run_5.png
This pie chart provides a detailed breakdown of ease-of-use ratings specifically for the final version (Run 5). The chart shows that 100% of users rated the app as "Very Easy" to use, represented by a single colored slice. This visualization serves as strong evidence of the app's successful usability optimization by the final iteration.

The MVP has been successfully validated with all core features working as intended and receiving positive user feedback. The app effectively helps users reflect on their day, track moods, and maintain consistent journaling habits through gamification. While some users suggested additional features, the core functionality meets the needs of the target demographic.
