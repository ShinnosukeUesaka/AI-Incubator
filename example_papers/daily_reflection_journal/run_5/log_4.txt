THOUGHT:  
Alex is pleased to see their journal entry displayed clearly. They like the simplicity of the interface and how easy it is to review past reflections. However, they notice that the mood they included ("happy") isn't displayed alongside the entry, which feels like a missed opportunity for tracking emotional trends. Alex wonders if the app provides any statistics or insights about their mood over time. They decide to check their stats to see if there's more detailed information available.  

COMMAND:  
stats

APP OUTPUT:
Your Progress:

THOUGHT:  
Alex is satisfied with the basic stats provided but feels the app could offer more detailed insights, such as mood trends over time or a breakdown of emotions by percentage. They appreciate the simplicity but think additional analytics could make the app more valuable for someone like them, who is data-driven and interested in personal growth. Alex decides to close the app for now and return tomorrow to continue their streak. They plan to use the app consistently to earn the "3-day Streak" badge and explore its long-term benefits.
