THOUGHT:  
Alex Carter, a digital marketing manager with a strong interest in mindfulness and personal development, has just opened the Daily Reflection Journal app. They are intrigued by the concept of daily journaling to reflect on their day and maintain a streak for earning badges. Alex appreciates the clean and straightforward introduction, which aligns with their preference for minimalist and functional design. They are curious about how the app works and want to explore its features to see if it can fit into their daily routine.  

Alex decides to start by adding a journal entry to test the functionality. They are slightly confused about whether they should include a mood with their entry or not, as the help message provides two options: one with a mood and one without. They decide to try both to see how the app handles it.
