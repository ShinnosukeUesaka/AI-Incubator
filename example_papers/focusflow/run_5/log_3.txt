THOUGHT:  
Alex is intrigued by the app's promise of boosting productivity, especially since they often struggle with staying focused during long coding sessions. They are curious about how the Pomodoro timer and task management features work, as these align with their need for structured work intervals. The reward system also catches their attention—they wonder if it will motivate them to stay consistent. However, they are slightly confused about how to get started and what specific commands are available. They decide to explore the app further by typing 'help' to understand the available features and commands.

COMMAND:  
help

APP OUTPUT:
Available commands:
add <task> - Add a new task
add priority <n> <task> - Add task with priority (1-5)
list - Show all tasks
complete <n> - Mark task n as completed
start [minutes] - Begin focus session (default: 25, or specify duration)
stop - End focus session
points - Show earned points
focus - Toggle focus mode

Tip: Use 'start 50' for a 50-minute focus session

THOUGHT:  
Alex is pleased to see a clear list of commands and appreciates the simplicity of the interface. They decide to test the task management feature first, as they have a few tasks they need to prioritize for the day. They start by adding a high-priority task: "Refactor code for project X." They also add a lower-priority task: "Research new AI frameworks." Alex likes how straightforward the command structure is but wonders if the app will allow them to edit tasks later if priorities change. After adding the tasks, they check the list to ensure everything is correct. They are now ready to test the Pomodoro timer and see how the focus mode works.

COMMAND:  
add priority 1 Refactor code for project X

APP OUTPUT:
Added task: refactor code for project x (Priority: 1)

THOUGHT:  
Alex is satisfied that the task was added successfully with the correct priority. They appreciate the immediate feedback from the app, which confirms the task has been logged. Next, they decide to add another task, this time with a lower priority, to see how the app handles multiple tasks. They are curious about how the app will display tasks with different priorities and whether it will sort them automatically. They also wonder if the app will allow them to see completed tasks separately from pending ones. For now, they proceed to add the second task.

COMMAND:  
add priority 4 Research new AI frameworks

APP OUTPUT:
Added task: research new ai frameworks (Priority: 4)

THOUGHT:  
Alex is pleased that the second task was added successfully. They are now ready to see how the app organizes and displays the tasks. They want to ensure that the app sorts tasks by priority, as this would help them focus on the most important tasks first. They also wonder if the app provides any visual cues or color-coding for different priorities. Alex decides to use the 'list' command to view all the tasks they've added so far. They are curious to see if the app will display the tasks in a clear and intuitive way.

COMMAND:  
list

APP OUTPUT:
Your tasks (1=highest priority, 5=lowest):
1. [ ] refactor code for project x (Priority: 1)
2. [ ] research new ai frameworks (Priority: 4)

THOUGHT:  
Alex is impressed with how the app clearly lists the tasks along with their priorities. They like the simplicity of the interface and the fact that the tasks are numbered, making it easy to reference them later. They notice that the app sorts tasks by priority, which aligns with their workflow. However, they wonder if the app will allow them to reorder tasks manually or if it strictly follows priority-based sorting. They also think about how the app will handle marking tasks as completed and whether it will provide any visual feedback or rewards for completing tasks. For now, they decide to test the Pomodoro timer to see how it integrates with their task list.

COMMAND:  
start 30

APP OUTPUT:
Starting focus session for 30 minutes...
Focus mode activated. Distractions blocked.
Break time: 6 minutes

THOUGHT:  
Alex is excited to start their first focus session with the app. They appreciate that the app automatically activates focus mode to block distractions, which is a feature they value highly. They also like that the app provides a break time suggestion, as this aligns with their goal of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. However, they are slightly curious about how the app determines the break time and whether it can be customized. They decide to focus on their high-priority task, "Refactor code for project X," during this session. They set a mental note to check the app's reward system after completing the session to see how points are awarded.

COMMAND:  
stop

APP OUTPUT:
Focus session completed! You earned 10 points.
Total points: 10 (Level 1)
Earn 90 more points to reach Level 2!
Take a 6 minute break.

Productivity Insights:
- Total focus time: 30 minutes
- Average session length: 30.0 minutes
- Total sessions completed: 1

THOUGHT:  
Alex is pleased with the feedback from the app after completing their focus session. They like the immediate reward of 10 points and the progress tracking toward the next level. The productivity insights are a nice touch, as they provide a clear summary of their work session. They wonder if the app will track longer-term trends, such as weekly or monthly productivity metrics. Alex decides to take the suggested 6-minute break to stretch and grab a glass of water. During the break, they think about how they can integrate this app into their daily routine, especially during busy workdays. After the break, they plan to mark their high-priority task as completed and explore the focus mode further.

COMMAND:  
complete 1

APP OUTPUT:
Marked task 1 as completed

THOUGHT:  
Alex is satisfied that the task was marked as completed successfully. They appreciate the simplicity of the command and the immediate feedback from the app. They wonder if the app will provide any additional rewards or insights for completing tasks, especially high-priority ones. They also think about how the app will handle completed tasks in the task list—will they be hidden, archived, or displayed separately? Alex decides to check the task list again to see how the completed task is displayed. They are also curious about how the app will handle their next focus session and whether it will suggest tasks based on priority.

COMMAND:  
list

APP OUTPUT:
Your tasks (1=highest priority, 5=lowest):
1. [x] refactor code for project x (Priority: 1)
2. [ ] research new ai frameworks (Priority: 4)

THOUGHT:  
Alex notices that the completed task is marked with an "x," which is a clear and simple way to indicate completion. They like that the app keeps completed tasks visible in the list, as this allows them to track their progress. However, they wonder if there is a way to archive or hide completed tasks to declutter the list over time. They also think about how the app might integrate with other tools they use, such as their calendar or project management software. For now, they decide to start another focus session to work on their remaining task, "Research new AI frameworks." They are curious to see if the app will suggest tasks based on priority or if they need to manually select the next task.

COMMAND:  
start 25

APP OUTPUT:
Starting focus session for 25 minutes...
Focus mode activated. Distractions blocked.
Break time: 5 minutes

THOUGHT:  
Alex is ready to dive into their next focus session. They appreciate that the app defaults to a 25-minute session, which aligns with the traditional Pomodoro technique. They also like that the app automatically activates focus mode, as this helps them stay distraction-free. They wonder if the app will provide any reminders or nudges during the session, such as encouraging them to stay focused or take short breaks. They decide to focus on their remaining task, "Research new AI frameworks," during this session. They set a mental note to check the app's reward system after completing the session to see how their points accumulate.

COMMAND:  
stop

APP OUTPUT:
Focus session completed! You earned 10 points.
Total points: 20 (Level 1)
Earn 80 more points to reach Level 2!
Take a 5 minute break.

Productivity Insights:
- Total focus time: 55 minutes
