Somewhat,Somewhat higher,Not motivating,"The app could improve by providing clearer feedback on how points are earned and how tasks contribute to progress. Adding a progress tracker for tasks and more detailed explanations of the reward system would make it more motivating. Additionally, allowing users to customize task priorities and providing more detailed task management features (e.g., sub-tasks or due dates) would enhance its functionality.","The focus mode and Pomodoro-style timer were the most helpful features, as they effectively blocked distractions and helped me stay on task during work sessions. The simplicity of the interface was also a plus, making it easy to get started without a steep learning curve.",respondent_1

Somewhat,About the same,Not motivating,"The task management feature needs significant improvement. Tasks should be added separately and not combined into one. Additionally, the app should allow users to manually set task priorities and possibly include subtasks or categories for better organization. The focus mode worked well, but it would be helpful to have more customization options, such as selecting specific apps or websites to block. Finally, the reward system could be more engaging and motivating, perhaps by offering tangible rewards or integrating with other productivity tools.","The focus mode was the most helpful feature. It effectively blocked distractions, which is crucial for maintaining focus during work sessions. The simplicity of the commands and the clear interface also made the app easy to use, despite the issues with task management.",respondent_3
