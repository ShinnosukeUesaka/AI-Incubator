THOUGHT:  
Alex Carter, being a tech-savvy professional, is intrigued by the app's promise of boosting productivity. They are particularly interested in the Pomodoro timer and the focus mode, as these align with their need for efficient time management and minimizing distractions. Alex is curious about how the app integrates task management and the reward system, as they enjoy gamified productivity tools. They are not confused at this point but are eager to explore the app further.  

COMMAND:  
help

APP OUTPUT:
Available commands:
add <task> - Add a new task
list - Show all tasks
start - Begin focus session
stop - End focus session
points - Show earned points
focus - Toggle focus mode

THOUGHT:  
Alex is pleased with the straightforward command structure and appreciates the simplicity of the app. They decide to start by adding a task to test the task management feature. Alex is curious about how the app handles task prioritization and whether it integrates with their existing workflow tools. They also note the focus mode and reward system, which they plan to explore later.  

COMMAND:  
add Finish MVP testing for FocusFlow

APP OUTPUT:
Added task: finish mvp testing for focusflow (Priority: 3)

THOUGHT:  
Alex is satisfied that the task was added successfully but is slightly confused about the "Priority: 3" label. They wonder if the app automatically assigns priorities or if this is a default setting. Alex decides to check their task list to see if the priority can be adjusted or if additional tasks can be added with different priorities. They also consider testing the focus session feature next to see how it integrates with task management.  

COMMAND:  
list

APP OUTPUT:
Your tasks (1=highest priority, 5=lowest):
1. finish mvp testing for focusflow (Priority: 3)

THOUGHT:  
Alex notices that the task list is displayed with a clear priority system, which they find useful for organizing their workload. However, they are still unsure how the priority was assigned and whether it can be modified. They decide to add another task to see if the app allows manual priority assignment or if it defaults to Priority 3. Alex is also curious about how the app handles multiple tasks and whether it integrates with the Pomodoro timer.  

COMMAND:  
add Review competitor productivity apps (Priority: 1)

APP OUTPUT:
Added task: review competitor productivity apps (priority: 1) (Priority: 3)

THOUGHT:  
Alex is now confused because the app seems to have ignored the manual priority they specified ("Priority: 1") and defaulted to Priority 3 again. They wonder if the app supports custom priorities or if this is a bug. Alex decides to check the task list again to confirm the priority of the new task and see if there’s a way to adjust priorities. They also consider testing the focus session feature to see if it interacts with the task list.  

COMMAND:  
list

APP OUTPUT:
Your tasks (1=highest priority, 5=lowest):
1. finish mvp testing for focusflow (Priority: 3)
2. review competitor productivity apps (priority: 1) (Priority: 3)

THOUGHT:  
Alex confirms that the app is not respecting the manual priority input, which is frustrating. They decide to test the focus session feature to see if it can help them work on the tasks despite this issue. Alex is curious about how the Pomodoro timer works and whether it integrates with the task list. They also wonder if the reward system will motivate them to complete tasks.  

COMMAND:  
start

APP OUTPUT:
Starting focus session for 25 minutes...
Focus mode activated. Distractions blocked.

THOUGHT:  
Alex is pleased that the focus session started smoothly and that focus mode is blocking distractions. They appreciate the simplicity of the Pomodoro timer and decide to use this time to work on the task "finish mvp testing for focusflow." Alex wonders if the app will track their progress or provide feedback after the session ends. They also consider testing the reward system after completing the session.  

COMMAND:  
stop

APP OUTPUT:
Focus session completed! You earned 10 points.
Total points: 10
Take a 5 minute break.

THOUGHT:  
Alex is happy to see that the app rewards points for completing a focus session, which aligns with their love for gamified productivity tools. They decide to take the suggested 5-minute break and use this time to reflect on the app's performance so far. Alex is curious about how the points system works and whether the points can be redeemed for anything. They also plan to test the focus mode toggle next to see how it handles distractions.  

COMMAND:  
focus

APP OUTPUT:
Focus mode activated.

THOUGHT:  
Alex is satisfied that focus mode is working as expected. They decide to test the app's ability to block distractions by attempting to access a distracting website. If the app successfully blocks it, Alex will be impressed. They also plan to check their task list again after the break to see if the app marks completed tasks or provides any progress tracking.  

COMMAND:  
list

APP OUTPUT:
Your tasks (1=highest priority, 5=lowest):
1. finish mvp testing for focusflow (Priority: 3)
2. review competitor productivity apps (priority: 1) (Priority: 3)

THOUGHT:  
Alex notices that the task list hasn’t changed, which is expected since they haven’t marked any tasks as completed. They wonder if the app has a feature to mark tasks as done or if it automatically detects task completion based on focus sessions. Alex decides to test the reward system further by starting another focus session to see if they can earn more points.  

COMMAND:  
start

APP OUTPUT:
Starting focus session for 25 minutes...
Focus mode activated. Distractions blocked.
