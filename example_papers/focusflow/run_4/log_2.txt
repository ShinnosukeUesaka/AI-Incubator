They choose a personal task related to their fitness routine, as they value maintaining a healthy lifestyle. After adding the second task, they plan to review the list to ensure both tasks are displayed correctly and prioritized as intended.

They appreciate the visual distinction between high and low-priority tasks, which aligns with their need for efficiency and organization. They decide to test the Pomodoro timer by starting a focus session on the high-priority task.
