Open Ended Responses (Sample):

Q: What improvements would you suggest for the app?
Response 1: The task management feature needs significant improvement. Tasks should be added separately and not combined into one. Additionally, the app should allow users to manually set task priorities and possibly include subtasks or categories for better organization. The focus mode worked well, but it would be helpful to have more customization options, such as selecting specific apps or websites to block. Finally, the reward system could be more engaging and motivating, perhaps by offering tangible rewards or integrating with other productivity tools.
Response 2: The app could improve by providing clearer feedback on how points are earned and how tasks contribute to progress. Adding a progress tracker for tasks and more detailed explanations of the reward system would make it more motivating. Additionally, allowing users to customize task priorities and providing more detailed task management features (e.g., sub-tasks or due dates) would enhance its functionality.

Q: What did you find most helpful about the app?
Response 1: The focus mode was the most helpful feature. It effectively blocked distractions, which is crucial for maintaining focus during work sessions. The simplicity of the commands and the clear interface also made the app easy to use, despite the issues with task management.
Response 2: The focus mode and Pomodoro-style timer were the most helpful features, as they effectively blocked distractions and helped me stay on task during work sessions. The simplicity of the interface was also a plus, making it easy to get started without a steep learning curve.

Open Ended Responses (Sample):

Q: What improvements would you suggest for the app?
Response 1: The app could improve by allowing users to set custom priorities while adding tasks, providing a way to mark tasks as completed manually, and clarifying how the reward system works. Additionally, features like subtasks, due dates, and recurring tasks would make the app more versatile and useful for complex workflows.
Response 2: The priority system needs to be fixed—it doesn't assign the correct priorities to tasks, which is a major drawback for task management. Additionally, the reward system could be more engaging, perhaps with visual progress indicators or more immediate feedback during focus sessions. Finally, adding a feature to customize focus session durations would be helpful, as 25 minutes might not always suit everyone's workflow.

Q: What did you find most helpful about the app?
Response 1: The focus mode and Pomodoro timer were the most helpful features, as they effectively blocked distractions and provided a structured way to manage work sessions. The simplicity of the commands also made the app easy to use.
Response 2: The focus mode and Pomodoro timer were the most helpful features. They effectively blocked distractions and provided a structured way to work in intervals, which aligns well with my productivity style.
